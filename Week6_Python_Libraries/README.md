# Introduction to Python Third Party Libraries(Packages)

This content is designed to introduce new developers to managing third-party packages using the Python package index and a tool called Pip. This course is part of a series of content designed to help you learn to program with the Python programming language

## Learning Objectives

- The Python Package Index
- The tool used to manage packages called pip
- The tool used to create isolated Python environments named venv
- Considerations to be made before installing a third-party package
- Third-Party Libraries

Python ships with a lovely standard library, which is a collection of packages and modules that are available on every machine that runs Python. However, you'll soon find that it doesn't contain everything you need. When this happens, you have two options:

### Writing your own supporting package yourself

Use someoneâ€™s else code

### Introduction to Packages(Before Third Parties)

The subject of packaging is an ever-evolving, overly complex part of Python development. Rather than focus on specific tools, the main focus of this section is on some general code organization principles that will prove useful no matter what tools you later use to give code away or manage dependencies.
